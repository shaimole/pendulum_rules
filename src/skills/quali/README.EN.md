### Actions

|Ability|EN|ZZ|Effect|Condition(s)|
| - | :-: | :-: | - | - |
||||||
|*Get Attention*|1|1|The character specifically draws the attention of everyone or one person or even animals in the immediate vicinity: RH vs SG. In combat, this allows them to move to attack him; in everyday life, it allows him to distract them from other things, such as a passing ally (+5 to IF) or a thief in action (+5 to FF). |Does not work against undead, constructs, etc.|.
|*Exposure*|0|1|The character shakes off the attention of an attacker for one turn (RH vs BW) and if successful also disengages from combat without consequences.|Does not work against undead, constructs, etc.|
|*Exposure Game*|2|/|The character plays with body language and hints, which adds his skill level of deception to the evasion value (AK) for the rest of the fight.|-|
|*False Gambler*|0|-|Tactical Deception at the Gambling Table: Adds 1-5 to gambling rolls, but may be noticed: Dexterity (FF) vs Awareness (BW)+ SG.|Only works on games that are also "cheatable". Not for example in horse racing.|
|*Nasty Trick*|1|/|The character immediately decides a blade lock in his favor through trickery and routine.|It is only possible once per opponent.
|*Feint*|1|1|The character feints RH against BW before proceeding to the actual attack.On success, the target suffers 150% of the damage and becomes disoriented for one roundBut only works once per opponent.|Does not work against undead, constructs, etc.|
|*Death*|0|1|The character believably fakes his knockout or death: RH vs BW + SG.Or he feigns death: usually no roll needed, otherwise also RH + 10 vs VS.|Does not work against some animal species, undead, vampires, etc.|.
|*Acting*|1|/|The character playfully slips into any role, such as that of a noble, a city guard, or a priest - assuming the correct garb or situation. Rolls (RH + 5 vs. BW) are rarely needed and can usually only be triggered by superiors (such as captains or high priests) or trained agents.| Often requires appropriate clothing and must often be prepared over the course of a day.
|*Unthreatening*|1|/|The character pretends to be weak, helpless and a low threat (RH vs SG), so most enemies ignore him until he attacks them or stands out e.g. by fighting strength.|Does not work against undead, constructs, etc.|
|*Submerge*|0|1|The character submerges himself in a crowd of people by blending in, quickly changing a piece of clothing, or standing inconspicuously at a market stall to haggle: (IF vs BW). If he succeeds, he shakes off his pursuers.|Crowd must be large enough|
|*Perfect Lie*|1|-|A statement or lie (such as *I am not a burglar, but an agent of your master.*") is delivered with such chutzpah and self-confidence (+ 15 RH) that for a moment it seems absolutely credible. However, the target will realize his mistake after a short time.|If the *"Perfect Lie*" fails, the liar loses all credibility.|

### Activities

|*Stage Play*|The character is acting in front of an audience. He jokes, makes a fool of himself, talks, rages, and performs various slides and monologues to impress his audience (CH + TH vs SG). Other actors, background music, scenery, extras, and more reduce the malus, often significantly.Note: Stage plays and lyrics must be memorized similar to potions or blueprints.|Disguises if possible|-|
|*Disguise Adjustment*|The character adjusts his or a disguise. This allows him to either add his crafting value (HW) and +2 to his acting (if he is pretending to be someone else) or to transfer his disguise value (CH + TH) to his allies.|Tailor Set|-|
