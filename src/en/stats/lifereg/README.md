# Regeneration 
- Stamina (EN) is fully recharged after each undisturbed rest.
- Hit Points (TP) are fully recharged as long as there are enough points left in the Health Reservoir (LP).
- Per day, the character regenerates 5% of his Life Points (LP).
- Lack of food and sleep disable Stamina regeneration and halve that of Hit Points.
