Explanation

Discipline: subcategory of a power domain, extended by the worshipped power source.

Domain: Upper category of disciplines, contains three subcategories each, called disciplines.

Casting Form (WF): Is the way a spell is cast - whether it is projected or manipulates an event.

Domains and Affiliation

A priest character must first choose a primary domain (such as light, fire, night, nature, darkness, or the deep) from which to draw his power. Any disciplines learned within it (each requiring only one skill point to unlock) automatically expand as the domain itself increases. Disciplines outside of one's power source, on the other hand, must be learned and increased separately (also with skill points).

| Absolute | 1-X | 1 | Strengthen | MP | 7.5 m | Stimulates the caster or target to the maximum and extends his next roll by (Willpower / 2) indefinitely, where here 1 EN = 1 roll extension. Sufficient Stamina given, this can overcome almost any SG and make a character swim up a waterfall for example (AT-SG 50). Causes a stress point at the target though. | - |

| Rapture | 1 | 3 | Stun | MP | 4.5 m | Powerful pain relief spell that puts the caster or target into a painless stupor. In combat, the target gains +100% hit points from the Health reservoir, but suffers -4 to all rolls. Outside of combat, stun reduces 3-5 stress without resistance (SG 20) and allows the target to be surgically treated effortlessly. Can be addictive, however (PY vs SG 18). | - |
| Fanaticism | 1 | 2 | Strengthen | MP | 4.5 m | Infuses the target or caster with a wasteful, highly dangerous form of power budget: For five rounds or (out of combat) for five minutes, its health points become hit points. After the casting time, the target collapses, suffers 3 stress and remains in a knockout state for the next 24 hours. | Works also against enemies (MP vs KN + 10), but not against undead, constructs, etc. |
| Firewalker | 1 | Strengthen | MP | B | Stimulates the caster or a target enormously and beyond any pain threshold. It gains +5 on all rolls, +10 armor value and +50% damage and effect on any spell, but falls into a knockout after three turns | - |
| God Strike | 1-3 | 2 | Strengthen | MP | 3 m | Gives the caster or a target immense physical strength for one round or (outside of combat) for about 10 seconds. This varies:1 EN = +15 AW for weapons of war, +100% damage.2 EN = +20 AW for weapons of war, +200% damage3 EN = +25 AW for weapons of war, +400% damageBut due to the overload, the target suffers 20 points of damage. | Possible only once per target in combat. The first time, the target must cast WK against SG 20 to see if it is not disoriented by the immense force. |
| Invigoration | 0-1 | 2 | Strengthen | MP | 10 m | Activates power reserves in the target and instantly recovers it from knockout by transferring 25% of its Hit Points (TP) from its Life Points (LP) reservoir.Can be shortened to a timeless Free Action against 1 Stamina (EN). | Only possible once per target per day. |
| Cat Jump | 1 | 1 | Strengthen | MP | 4.5 m | Magically stimulates the legs of the caster or a target, allowing them to jump up or forward up to ten meters. This jump must be aimed (BE or ranged AP vs SG) and can even result in serious injury if it ends in a wall or free fall. | - |
| Clarity | 0 | 2 | Strengthen | MP | 4.5 m | Strengthens and steels the mind of the caster or a target for one fight or five minutes. During this time, it cannot become confused, disoriented, mentally stunned, mind controlled, suffer mali from fear, or build up stress. | Can only be cast once per target per day. Casting it twice can cause 3 stress (SG 25). |
| Warrior Strength | 1 | Strengthen | MP | 10 m | Grants the caster or a target + (HP / 3) Attack Value (AW) and Projection Value (PJ) and +50% damage (+100% if the character has 15 HP or more) for the rest of the fight. | Only applicable to one target at a time. |
| Critical Focus | 1-2 | 1 | Strengthen | MP | 10 m | Allows a target to count as a Critical success during the next roll already one W15. Can also be cast as a Free Action for an additional point of Stamina (EN). | Not applicable to the caster. |
| Critical Moment | 2 | 1 | Strengthen | MP | 7.5 m | Stimulates the caster or target to the maximum and makes his next actions (like an attack or a steal) end in a Critical Success. However, causes a stress point on him. | Possible only once per target per day |
| Nervousness | 0-1 | 1 | Debilitate / Curse | MP | 10 m | Inflicts disruptive Nervousness (MP vs. PY) on a target, making it very difficult for him to cast: His MP or PY must exceed a SG of 20, otherwise the spell ends in failure. A critical roll (W20) breaks the curse. Lasts about a minute.Against 1 Stamina (EN) the SG is increased to 30. | Works only against living targets. |
| Restlessness | 1 | 1 | Strengthen | MP | B | Strengthens the caster or a target so that it does not suffer final exhaustion for a day. It can spend a night without sleep, force march all day, and consume EN above its Stamina maximum (with each point above causing 1 Stress). | - |
| Return | 3 | 2 | Strengthen | MP | 4.5 m | Maximum Invigoration: Instantly brings the target back from knockout by transferring 100% of his Hit Points (TP) from his Life Points (LP) reservoir. However, disables EN regeneration until the next but one rest and causes 3 stress without resistance. | - |
| Release Pain | 1 | 5 | Strengthen | MP | 4.5 m | Takes away all weak or chronic pain from the target or caster for one day. Meanwhile, diseases or overstress no longer claim a malus, but are not stopped in their progress. | - |
| Steel Shoulders | 1 | - | Strengthen | MP | B | Gives the target immense strength endurance for one day, which not only allows him to wear armor two classes above his without malus, but also a second backpack (with corresponding inventory slots). | - |
| Stoneflesh | 1 | 1 | Protection | MP | 7.5 m | Grants the caster or a target +(Intelligence / 3) armor value for 10 minutes or the rest of the fight. | - |

| Spell | EN | ZZ | Type | WF | RW | Description and Effect | Condition(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Command | 0-2 | 2 | Submission | AU | 4.5 m | Forces a target to perform an action when successful (AU vs. PY). Once this is accomplished, it realizes its mistake and will act accordingly. The type of command varies with the use of Stamina (EN):Without EN: Performs an act that will have little consequence, such as handing over an item, flipping a switch, or opening a blouse.With EN: Performs a dangerous act, such as opening a secured door, attacking an ally once, or throwing away a weapon.Can also be cast immediately for the use of one more point of EN. | Can only force the target to take physical action. |
| Domination | 1 | 3 | Subjugation /Channeling | AU | B | Channeling: The caster touches a creature and begins to subjugate its will (AU vs. PY +5). If successful, it can no longer resist for the duration of the Domination attempt. The caster must succeed two more times (for a total of three) after that (AU vs PY) until he breaks the target. A failure only means that he has to try the last subjugation step again; after two failures, however, the domination breaks. If successful, the creature submits to the caster much like a trained animal, but with multiple allegiance (though not to the point of suicide). However, after a day's time, it must be held at the cost of 2 or 4 Stamina (EN). With only 2, it is granted a resistance roll (PY against AU). | Works only against small animals at first, but gets stronger in the long run. |
| Leave Impression | 1 | 2 | Telepathy / Curse | AU | 4.5 m | The caster leaves a kind of psychic mark on the target if successful (AU vs. PY). The target feels it more as an impression and will often think of the caster for the next days or try to find out more about him. Also boosts all Domination and Oneiromancy powers by +3 AU. | - |
| Shudder | 0 | 1 | Alp | AU | 7.5 m | Fills the target with a horror vision in a flash if successful (AU vs. PY), disorienting it for one turn. | - |
| Fear | 0 | 1 | Alp | AU | 7.5 m | Fills the target with a persistent fear on success (AU vs. PY), lowering its rolls by 2 for the rest of the battle or ten minutes. |
 |
| Credibility | 1 | 3 | Telepathy | AU | 3 m | The caster paralyzes a target's sense of truth for a few moments on success, allowing him to tell the most bizarre lies (grants +15 RH). After one hour at the latest, however, the target realizes his mistake and reacts accordingly. | Only possible once per person, regardless of success or failure. |
| Horror | 1 | 1-X | Alp / Channeling | AU | 7.5 m | Channeling: If successful, makes the target feel more of a sense of horror each round (such as a choking sensation), lowering its rolls by 2 each round for the rest of the fight. If it successfully resists, the channeling is canceled. If, on the other hand, it reaches 0 Psyche (PY), it sinks into war tremors, unable to fight. Should the target reconsider the encounter, it will think back on this moment for a long time. | 
| Panic | 1 | 1 | Alp | AU | 7.5 m | Floods a target with tremendous fear if successful (BE vs. WK +5), causing it to flee immediately or freeze in fear for three rounds. If the attempt fails, the target becomes immune to a second attempt. | - |
| Presence | 1-2 | 2 | Alp | AU | 3 m | Surrounds the caster with an aura of physical presence. People are impressed by it (+2 RH), enemies must always overcome before attacking him in melee (PY vs AU).Can be boosted immensely against 2 Stamina (EN), filling the caster with an incredibly authoritative, directly dangerous aura: +10 RH when intimidated. Can even intimidate groups. | - |
| Silence | 1 | 2 | Subjugation | AU | 7.5 m | Mentally blocks a target on success, making it very difficult for him to approach or attack the caster (PY vs SG 25 per attempt). | Can only be attempted once per person. |
| Suicide | 1 | 3 | Subjugation / Channeling | AU | 7.5 m | Channeling: Uncanny compulsion against conscious targets over 3 R:R. 1: AU against PY; the target feels bad. It knows that the caster has invaded its mind and can warn others about it, for example.R. 2: AU vs. PY +5; the target pauses disoriented. Even if it can break free, it remains disoriented for 3 rounds.Round 3: AU vs PY +10; the target attempts to take its own life for three rounds. | Can only be attempted once per person. |
| Spontaneity | 0-1 | 3 | Telepathy | AU | 3 m | If successful (AU vs. PY), makes the target say what is on his mind. Against the use of 1 Stamina (EN), makes it utter what it is craving most at the moment. | Only possible once per person. |
| Suggestion | 2 | 3 | Submission | AU | 3 m | Seduce the target (AU vs. PY +5) to perform a more complex command, such as fighting an ally, having intercourse with the caster, or escorting it through a fortress. It will also not realize its mistake afterwards, but will invent excuses for this act itself or will not deal with it. | The target must have been previously impressed with leaving an impression. |
| Scare away vermin | 0 | - | Alp | AU | 10 m | Scares away all vermin (like cockroaches, mice and rats, but also lice from the hair) in a radius of about ten meters around the caster for a daytime. Can have a de-stressing effect in certain cases. | Only possible once per rest. |
| Force Truth | 1 | 3 | Submission | AU | B | If successful, forces a conscious (fixed if possible) target to answer a question truthfully on contact or simply speak the truth. With each question, the bonus to the target's Willpower (PY) increases by 2. | - |
| Speaking Truth | 0 | 2 | Submission / Channeling | AU | 4.5 m | Forbids a target from speaking lies if successful (AU vs. PY). It does not notice that or by whom it is blocked and will blame it afterwards on nervousness or own obduracy. | - |
| Willpower | 2 | 3 | Strengthen | AU | 3 m | Grants the caster or a target complete immunity to fear and stress rolls for one day. Can only be cast on one target at a time. | Only works against the living. |

### Rituals: Domination

NOTE: Domination rituals can only be performed against targets that have previously been opened with Leave an Impression.

| Activity | Effect | Pocket | Consumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Occupy | The caster puts himself into a target up to 10 km away (AU vs. PY) and subconsciously forces it to execute his commands or share thoughts without the target noticing this influence. Meanwhile, the can only slightly perceive what the target is experiencing, which is why he should be close to it or otherwise monitor it. The target can resist any command (BE against WK). Orders that are too drastic, such as a murder, suicide, or serious crime, must be whispered over a long period of time. | Caster Pocket | 2 Charges2 Stress |
| Nesting | The caster combines his mind dominantly and aggressively with that of a target up to 10 km away to make himself susceptible to further rituals. The target must have been previously marked by leaving an impression. The target senses this intrusion and may even perceive it as hostile or dangerous (caster's PY vs. PY). A caster near him will notice the intrusion immediately, but not if it has already been completed. | caster pocket | 1 charge |
| Servant | Subdues the will of a target in front of the caster (fixed if possible) so that it serves him for one day. This servant will not resist, fight at its side, will to the caster in any other way, nor act like a mentally subjugated slave creature, even if it mostly shrouds itself in silence. However, it can still resist serious orders (AU vs. PY), such as the murder of a loved one or suicide. | Caster Pocket | 3 Charges |
| Reverse | If successful (AU vs. PY), manipulates a target no more than 10 km away into adopting the caster's point of view (or a point of view of the caster's choosing) without the target noticing. It will side with the caster in negotiations or discussions, or argue and judge in the caster's favor, but will not openly support him (e.g. attack his allies). | caster pocket | 1 charge |
| Subjugation | The ultimate domination: The caster subjugates a touched (if possible fixed) target over several attempts to become a willing servant. In doing so, he loosens his will a little more with each attempt (equal to the rules of learning, SG = PY of the target x 15). If the target was broken, it serves the caster unconditionally (with -3 on all spirit attributes) for months. It will fight by his side, even commit suicide for him, be available for any favor or service, and also argue on his behalf, though it is generally very reticent in words. If it is separated from the caster, it tries feverishly to return to him or fall into deep mourning.Only after 6 to 12 months the spell is released and this over a period of another 6 months, whereby the death of the caster plays no role here. If he (or another magic expert) releases the spell, it still takes at least 3 months until the target can act independently again. | Caster Bag | Causes1 Stress |

| All-Tongue | 1 | 5 | Vision | MP | B | Allows the caster or volunteer target to speak and (if learned) read in all languages for one day (VS vs SG 25). A Critical Failure (W1) reduces the target's Intelligence to 1 for one day | Causes 2 Stress. |
| Etheric Form | 1 | 1 | Banish | MP | 7.5 m | Puts the target into an etheric form (MP vs SG 20) for three rounds, in which it can no longer hurt, but also cannot attack. However, it can move ethereally twice as fast, but cannot pass through walls. | - |
| Destroy | 2 | 3 | Miracle | MP | 5 m | On success (MP vs WD +15), the maximum 200 kg target (such as an animal, beast, door, wall, or person as well as its equipment) crumbles to dust.

For example, a collapse is stopped, enemies lose interest for a short time, and the like. EN-effort varies with the danger to be banished. |
 |
| Contingency | 1 | 1 | Curse | MP | 4.5 m | Encloses a power (or, in cooperation with a mage, a spell) from a locally bound waiting field that is only released when previously defined conditions are met, such as saying a word or opening a door.

| Moiramancy | 1-X | 2 | Miracle | MP | 10 m | The caster changes an event in his favor (MP against SG), e.g. a door lock that pops open by itself; a guard who has to go to the privy at just the right moment; a merchant who loses an item from his pocket, etc. The SG as well as the EN consumption scale with the size and complexity of the change. | - |
| Negate | 2 | 1 | Miracle | MP | - | Profound, unaccountable intervention in reality that undoes an act just committed (such as a statement, an attack, a murder, or a sale): MP vs. SG. May result in dangerous consequences on a Critical Failure (W1). | Causes 2 Stress. | Portal | 2 | 5 | Teleportation | MP | Var. | Opens a magic portal between the caster's position and a magic strong place (like a cathedral, a mage tower or similar). The SG varies on two factors: First, if the portal is created, second (+10) if the exit portal is not too high, looks into a wall or vertically upwards. | The maximum distance varies with the power of the destination. |
| Rainbow Step | 1-X | 1 | Wall | MP | Var. | Makes the caster (and only the caster) walk across a bifrost, a rainbow bridge on which he can cross various obstacles, such as a river, a stream of lava, a ravine, or a spiked pit.

| Shadow Duplicate | 2 | Summon | MP | 3 m | Creates a fully controllable copy of the caster from living shadow that lasts for about ten minutes. It can do, perform, and accomplish anything the caster can, as well as perceive the world through its senses. However, it suffers -2 on all rolls and has only 30 hit points.

| Fate Debt | 0 | 1 | Strengthen /Curse | MP | B | The caster takes debts from Fate: He is granted a Critical Success or a Critical Failure averted, but must repay it as a Critical Failure in the next few days. A lucky roll on a similarly important trial determines when. Can be made and built up as often as desired. However, if the debt is granted to a target other than the caster, it requires two Critical Fails. | - |

| Petrify | 3 | 1 | Banish / Curse | MP | 10 m | Petrifies a living creature up to 250 kg with its equipment into an almost indestructible statue on success (MP vs WD +10). A lucky roll determines how long this curse lasts:1 = Not even a heartbeat (not)2-5 = One round6-10 = One day11-15 = Until the next twilight16-19 = One year20 = Forever, the target disintegrates into salt | - |
| Thinking Away | 2 | 5 | Curse | MP | 20 km | If successful (MP vs SG), no one talks or thinks about the caster for one day - unless this is absolutely unavoidable (e.g. during a trial). Plans against the caster can be delayed, even hashers stopped.

| Transfer Wounds | 1 | 2 | Curse | MP | 7.5 m | Transfers the fresh wounds, i.e. missing hit points, of one target (but not the caster) to another in two phases.

| Resurrection | If successful (MP vs. SG), resurrects someone who has been dead for a maximum of seven days (with 5% of his life points). This is usually accompanied by major character changes in the target, such as a psychopathy or chronic taciturnity. In addition, in case of failure or Critical Failure (W1), the consequences can be devastating, such as reawakening a nearby graveyard. The SG (minimum 25) varies with time elapsed since death, but can also be reduced by paraphernalia, such as a human heart, human sacrifice, or energist. | Caster Bag | 3 Charges |

| Implant Command | 2-X | - | Manipulation | MPPS | - | Character change in two phases: The caster first formulates a command, wish, or drive for the target (such as opening a locked door, handing over an item, or even killing a friend): PS vs. SG.

| Read Mind(Introjection) | 0-X | - | Vision | PS | - | Invokes various information during an introjection, such as: Memory: summons a memory in the target (PS vs SG) and thus can observe it.

Ripping out body parts paralyzes this in the victim. If the caster periodically whispers a command or thought to the doll, the victim will attempt to carry it out or accept it subconsciously (RH vs SG). Destroying the revenge doll may kill the victim (WD vs SG 25). However, if it survives, it is immune to any further revenge doll curse. | Casting Bag | 1 Charge |

### Rituals

| Activity | Effect | Bag | Consumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desolation | Drains a place in a radius of about 200 to 500 meters (depending on the enrichment of life, from meadow to forest) of part of its life energy. As a result, fields become barren in the next few days, trees and animals weak and sick, and the earth pale. However, the caster is flooded with life force in return and receives +3 to all rolls for a week. Alternatively, he can fill up to five life stones with energy.Works only in forests, also tundras, meadows like farmland and cities. | caster bag | 1 charge |
| Echo | The caster sees into the past of a place, especially and if possible fateful moments. These are not always harmless and can even be overwhelming (PY vs SG). EN consumption varies with the emotional scope of the memory. | Casting Bag | 1 Charge |
| Summon Spirit | The spirit of a deceased is summoned against its will and forced to answer (PY vs SG per question - a successfully refused answer costs the caster 1 EN). EN consumption as well as SG of controllability also vary greatly according to the spirit's power and age. Once the caster's Stamina (EN) is depleted, the spirit dissolves and escapes. Summoning it again, whether after release or escape, is significantly more difficult (SG +10).Aids: Several things cumulatively reduce the SG of the summon:- Personal effects = -1- A blood relative of the deceased = -1.- A bone or body part = -3- The corpse (does not work in combination with bone or body part) = -5 | Caster bag | 1 charge |
| Undead Construct | The caster awakens and stabilizes a corpse into a permanent servant that can henceforth perform simple tasks (such as guarding an area or doing household or storage chores), but also serves as a companion in combat. Its stats are derived from the original once alive, but -3). The undead draws its life energy from the environment, which slightly weakens not only the caster, but also all other beings in the immediate vicinity. If the construct is released, the caster dies or gets lost, it reduces within a few days or weeks to a simple revenant, which attacks everything living that crosses its path.Combination: If the spirit of the dead was called before, it can be locked into its old body and resurrected as an undead servant. This even has its old intelligence and values and can perform more complex tasks or even learn new ones. Over the years, however, his nature grows cold, as do his memories of life. ## Caster Bag ## 5 Charges

If unsuccessful, they suffer -3 to all rolls for the rest of the day. | Can be cast as a curse over time, but reduces the caster's maximum Stamina (EN) by 3 during this time. |

However, merchants may instinctively recognize these as counterfeits and reject them without giving any reason: RH vs BE. Troll money lasts for one hour. However, after successful trade and reconversion, the victim will remember the person who paid with it. | - |
| Troll Copy | 1 | 5 | Transformation /Illusion | RH | B | Creates a copy of an object up to about 20 kg from earth.
