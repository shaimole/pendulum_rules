### Spells: Arcanistics

| Spell | EN | ZZ | Type | WF | RW | Description and effect | Condition(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Amplification | 1 | 1 | Amplification | MP | - | Amplifies a spell by 100% of its effect, whether in damage, effect or duration. Requires another round before said spell to do so, however. Can also be cast on other targets, such as party members. | Does not work with every spell. |
| Antimagic Field | 1 | 2 | Banish | MP | 10 m /R: 3 m | Creates an antimagic field in which spells cannot be cast, magical (but not alchemical) buffs lose their effect, and artifacts such as amulets or wands no longer work. | Can be bridged e.g. by powerful casters or spells. |
| Aether Barrier | 1-X | 1 | Channeling / Shield | MP | 10 m /R: 3 m | Creates a dom-like shield that protects against almost any mana current (including ghosts or demons) by feeding on them. Demands 1 EN per round in combat, 1 EN per minute in everyday life. | - |
| Ether Flesh | 1-X | 1 | Manipulation | MP | B | Creates temporarily influenceable matter (like flesh) from ghostly mana. This can replace lost limbs, stop bleeding, serve as a temporary suture (+3 if Craft: Medicine is learned), or even (for 1 EN) create a third arm that carries a shield, for example. Lasts about one day. | - |
| Etheric Form | 1 | 2 | Banish | MP | 6 m | Transforms the target (or caster) into an etheric, floating form of existence for 5 rounds, even involuntarily (MP vs WD +5). In this it cannot be affected by the physical world, but cannot affect it either. Moreover, it is possible for it to float through walls, ceilings or floors, but also to perceive etheric beings or structures, the mana currents. Meanwhile, it is only recognized as a foggy shadow. | Can be restricted by magical barriers. Also does not work against magical creatures. |
| Aether Shock | 3 | 1 | Damage | MP | 7.5 m | Casts an anti-magic pulse that simultaneously drains mana while casting it into chaos. Disrupts any spell up to SG 30 and can cause from 30 to 1,000 points of damage against artifacts, apparati and magical creatures, as well as undead, depending on the target of magic. | - |
| Light Sphere | 0 | 1 | Companion | MP | 4 m | Creates a glowing, yielding light sphere that follows the caster floating and can perform simple commands. Its luminosity is equivalent to a torch (twilight). It can also throw itself into a target, collide with an object, or be grabbed out of the air by a person. Both will cause her to be extinguished and cause 2 points of damage. Otherwise lasts about one hour. | - |
| Mana Fire | 0 | 1 | Manipulation | MP | 8 m | Burns the mana in a caster or magic creature if successful (MP vs WD): This fire lasts for three rounds and causes 5 DMG / R against living creatures and 20 DMG / R against magical entities, while the pain requires -4 on all rolls. Spellcasting claims an additional 10 points of damage each from the afflicted. | Only works against spellcasters or magical entities. |
| Mana Needle | 0-1 | 1 | Projectile | PJ | 10 m | Target Seeking Mana Arrow: Deals 10 points of damage, is inescapable and armor piercing. Against one point of Stamina (EN), three arrows are fired at 10 points of damage each. | - |
| Null Shield | 1 | Protective Shield | MP | 8 m | Shield spell that shatters any mana connection before it is cast. Protects against magical effects for (Intelligence x 5) TP and retains the final attack, i.e.: even if it protects for only one TP, the spell is completely absorbed. | - |
| Zero Wall | 1 | 2 | Force Field | MP | 6 m | Creates a magic-devouring, mana-replacing wall 10 m long. It disorients when traversed (PY vs SG 25) and withstands (Intelligence x 80) points of magic damage. Lasts 10 minutes. | - |
| Signal | 0-X | 2 | Vision | PJ | var | Casts a magic signal over one kilometer, which can be perceived by all casters and magic creatures. The range can be varied by Stamina (EN): 1 km vs 1 EN. You can even embed an emotion in the signal (like a cry for help), but this increases the SG. | |
| Simulacrum | 3 | 2 | Summon | MP | 30 m | Temporarily creates a ghostly, glowing duplicate of the caster or a target from ether flesh that shares its thoughts and executes commands. Lasts about four hours and thirty meters.In Combat: Possesses (Intelligence x 3) TP and can participate with full stats (EN affects from the target).In Everyday Life: Can perform actions and even a simple activity with -3 on all rolls. For example, he can learn while his duplicate brews potions. | Requires an Energist in inventory. The mind expansion also creates 2 stress (SG 25) on the target, but becomes easier to bear with multiple uses. |
| Mirror | 1 | / | Shield | PT | B | Defensive Reflex Spell: Throws a projection spell (whether it would hit the character or another target) back to the caster. PT against PJ of the attacker. However, the attacker can also cast a mirror. | - |
| interference field | 0-1 | 1 | force field | MP | 10 m | Disturbs the aether with a chaos field, which is hard to notice even by casters (BE against SG 30). In this disturbance field, even a spell cast with a W5 is considered a Critical Failure. However, if a caster has discovered and understood the interference, he can easily bypass it.Against the use of 1 Stamina (EN), the interference field becomes infinitely modulative and can make all spells / powers a risk for the rest of the battle, but can also be noticed. | - |
| Opacity | 0-1 | 5 | Force Field | MP | 20 m | Surrounds the aether around the caster with a mist that makes any form of observation spell impossible. Can also fool alarm spells and runes against 1 EN, making them inactive. | - |
| Break Spell | 0 | 1 | Banish | MP | 6 m | Immediately breaks a simple spell, such as corrosion or acid blast. | - |
| Interrupt Spell | 1-2 | / | Projection | PT | 10 m | The caster hits another caster's spell in his defense turn and interrupts it if successful: MP vs. MP +5. | Possible only once per turn. |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Homunculus | Highly complex, under penalty forbidden creation of a duplicate from ether flesh (arcanism), which is filled with life functions and body heat (blood magic) and finally takes on a form (illusion). This duplicate is practically indistinguishable from a human: It bleeds, can eat, excrete, fight, perform sexual intercourse and even execute simple commands. If the required energist is inserted into it, the homunculus persists indefinitely. However, it is then capable of developing a will of its own. If a target is to be replicated, blood or flesh is required from it.For the rules of control, see Arcanism: Simulacrum. | Caster Pocket | 10 Charges,5 Stress |

| Empty Crystal | 0 | 3 | Manipulation | MP | B | Ability from Crystallomancy: Harmlessly empties an energy or storage crystal into the air, rendering it useless and/or usable elsewhere. | - |
| Reconfiguration | 0-1 | 1-/ | Manipulation | MP | 10 m | The caster rewrites an actively cast spell for his own purposes. This can be, for example, a shield that is either deactivated or even turned against the user, or a fireball that is being charged: MP vs MP + 10. The enemy caster may notice this - with increasing chance if his spells turn damaging against him or his allies: BE vs MP + SG.

### Rituals

| Activity | Effect | Bag | Consumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Crystallomancy | Creates from a rock crystal (or any other crystal or gemstone) a magical one, like a storage stone for life energy or souls, an energy crystal for later use or simply a short-lived light stone (see recipes).

High Risk: Soul Forming is considered extraordinarily dangerous, to caster and environment alike.

Soul shaping is also strictly forbidden.

### Skills

| Name | Effect | | LV |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Arcanism Circle 1 | | 0 |

Concentration: The caster boosts his own soul with the raw soul energy of an energist, gaining +1 (maximum +3) per charge on all or +15 on one roll for the rest of the day.

| Ghost Trap | 0 | 1 | Banishing Circle | MP | 3 m | The caster draws an invisible banishing circle and enriches it with phasmalistic magic, with different effects:Living: If a living creature enters the circle, it loses orientation and remains disoriented within it (BE vs SG 25), though it may attempt to break free each round.Undead: If an undead creature, whether revenant or vampire, enters the circle, it becomes fixed without resistance for one hour. However, it can still cast spells or fight back if someone gets too close.Ether Beings: If a spirit or disembodied demon hovers over it, or if a possessed person enters it, the ether being fixes almost incapable of action for one hour in the circle. | - |
| Spirit Fire | 0 | 1 | Projectile | PJ | 10 m | Concentrates the psychic energy from an energist into a projectile. This first deals 20 points of damage and tugs at the target's soul in such a way that its rolls for the next round are reduced by 10. | Requires an Energist charge and is only effective against living targets. |
| Spirit Guard | 0 | - | Manipulation | MP | B | Expands the caster's or a target's soul (MP vs SG) so that part of it hovers around him as an ethereal sense organ. In this form, the caster gains +2 to all combat-related rolls, +3 Perception, and an enhanced sense of the ether, but also suffers 2 Stress per time of day. |
 |
| Phosphorize | 0 | 5 | Vision | MP | 10 m | Enriches the aether web around the caster with weak but visible energy, making mana flows visible to the naked eye. This allows the caster to see ghosts, magic traps, hidden runes and sigils, as well as artifacts. Also grants +5 to Reconstruction (Priest - Darkness: Theamancy). | - |
| Soul Imprisonment | 1 | 3 | Manipulation | MP | 10 m | Soul Imprisonment for three rounds: Captures one (e.g., by ghost trap) in the first and fixes it (MP vs SG) more with each round. If the caster succeeds in the third round, locks the spirit or demon into a soulstone or person, even involuntarily (MP vs. PY). However, if the spirit does not want to stay in the person, it can leave it after one day at the latest (PY of the person against SG). | There must be a spirit or soul in the direct vicinity. |
| Extract Soul | 2 | - | Manipulation | MP | 3 m | Extracts the soul from a (if possible motionless, fixed) victim in three phases.1. phase: Breaks the physical resistance (MP against WD).2. phase: Captures the soul and its physical anchors (MP against SG)3. phase: Rips out the soul (MP against SG). Phase: Rips out the soul (MP vs PY).The soul is then torn out of the body and instinctively tries to return in it immediately. However, it can be prevented from doing so with soul lock or soul fire. The body then remains alive until it is either reoccupied or dies, at the latest by thirst. | - |
| Soul Bread | 0 | 1 | Reinforcement | MP | 4.5 m | Reinforces the soul of the caster or a target with an energist charge, granting it +(IN x2) Concentration (KE), Psyche (PY) and Understanding (VS) for one roll, also regenerates 2 Stamina (EN). | Consumes one Energist Charge and is only applicable once per rest per target. |
| Soul Dissection | 1 | - | Vision | MP | B | The caster probes into a trapped soul (whether through a spirit trap or in a soul stone) and searches it for memories or information. This dissection is usually low yielding (MP vs. high SG) and is often damaging to the caster.He has two approaches to this:Probe: Harmless penetration at high SG but low risk.Merge: Short term merge at medium SG but extreme risk. | The extreme sensory impacts cause 1 stress without resistance. |
| Soul Fire | 1 | 3 | Damage | PJ | 4.5 m | Disperses part of the target's soul if successful (MP vs. PY +10), with devastating effect: The target is first afflicted by immense confusion, lowering all its rolls by 6 for the next few minutes (like the rest of the fight). The target will then suffer from the mental weakening for the rest of his life and will always feel a sense of inner coldness. | - |
| Soul Whip | 0 | 1 | Projectile | PJ | 9 m | Projects a lance of soul energy decomposed into ectoplasm. This does 200 damage against ghosts and undead, which scatters or even destroys them on hit. A hit only disorients living targets (MP + 5 vs. PY). | Consumes an Energist Charge |
| Soul Tug | 0 | 1-X | Damage / Channeling | MP | 7.5 m | Tugs at the target's soul and strongly disorients it. The target can no longer act during this time (but can defend itself). Each round it spends in soul tugging, it loses for 4 (up to max. 16) on all rolls, but only for one round. If the spell ends, the rolls are restored after one round. | - |

### Rituals
| Activity | Effect | Bag | Consumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Create Energist | The caster decomposes a captured or stored soul into energy and preserves it into an energist: MP vs. SG. If unsuccessful, the caster can be injured due to the released energy or even, in case of a Critical Failure (W1), create a tiny grief that haunts people or the place. The energy charges here vary with the type of soul being processed: - Animal (such as dogs, wolves, or mountain lions) = 2-3 charges- Large animal (such as cows, bears, or mammoths) = 4-5 charges- Conscious being (such as humans, dwarves, or orcs) = 9-13 charges Higher, conscious being (such as elves or draconids) = 15-20 charges- Otherworldly being (such as demons) = 25-50 chargesGhosts, souls whose deaths occurred long ago, are usually only half as productive. | Caster Pocket | 1 Charge 1 Soul |
| Separate Soul | Risky ritual that, if successful (MP vs. often high SG), separates an undesirable character trait (such as irrational fears or a philia) from the target's mind. Can lead to dangerous side effects up to lifelong coma, reduced casts, or prolonged catatonia, but is relatively easily reversible (as long as the soul fragment has not disappeared or been made into an energist). || Soul Transfer | Ritual, which is initially similar to the Drain Soul spell in how it works (see the spells for more information). If successful, the target, the caster, or a second target swap souls. Both can then act with -2 on all rolls in the other's body, gaining the spirit attributes from the original and the body attributes from the new shell. After about three days, however, repulsion effects kick in: they gain access to each other's memories or abilities, while becoming progressively weaker. From then on, the new shell can go into catatonic state every day (PY against SG 15, +5 every day), from which it usually does not return. | Caster Bag | 5 Charges |
| Soul Link | The irreversible linking of one or two souls, with versatile effects:Person to Item: The caster expands a target's soul (even involuntarily, but then counts as soul draining) and transfers part of it into an item without ripping it out. As a result, person and object are connected. The person then always knows where the connection is, gets +3 on all rolls (like AW, VW for weapons or craft for tools), +25% damage and more, but also suffers from strange stress effects and bizarre emotions. If the item is also destroyed, the soul mate suffers immense feedback effects, such as great grief and -10 to all rolls and this for weeks or months. He will feel for the rest of his life as if he had lost a child or beloved pet.Person to Person: The caster extends the souls of two targets and implants a part in the other. Both persons will now become much closer and instinctively understand each other as siblings or lovers. They sense where approximately the other is and how he is doing there. Stress they share or intercept each other, while in each other's presence they receive +2 to all rolls. However, can also lead to madness, such as a growing desire to eat the other person. If one soul mate dies, the other suffers a huge knockback and can blunt them into a psychopath (PY vs SG 20) or make them insane (PY vs SG 10). | Casting Stone | 5 Charges |
| Imprint Sense Stone | Marks an empty soul stone with a memory or experience of the caster or (if successful: MP vs. SG) of a target, thus converting it to a sense stone. It can no longer be used as a soulstone or converted back into one. | Caster Pocket | 1 Charge |

| Spell | EN | ZZ | Type | WF | RW | Description and effect | Condition(s) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Anaphylaxis (B) | 1 | 1 | Damage | MP | BB | Makes a target extraordinarily sensitive on success (MP vs. WD) for one round, causing it to take +300% damage for one round plus minus 10 WD. | - |
| Autophage (B) | 1 / 4 | - | Manipulation | MP | BB | Doubles Health (LP) regeneration in the target (or the caster itself), but also doubles food requirements for one day.Can alternatively achieve an extreme regeneration form: This costs 4 EN, grants quadrupled LP regeneration (and hunger), weakens the target by 50% of its EN for one day, and causes it to suffer 2 stress. | - |
| Blood Band | 0-1 | 1 | Projectile | PJ | 6 m | Fires a black magic needle whip. If it hits, it connects caster and target, allowing Blood magic to be cast on the latter while also granting him +5 PJ against all connected targets. The link can only be cut by immense damage (40+) against the caster or antimagic. | Only works against creatures with blood, not undead, constructs, etc. |
| Blood Sacrifice (B) | 0 | / | Reinforcement | MP | BB | The caster uses his blood or that of a volunteer connected by a blood bond to reinforce himself (read: TP vs. effect). Examples:- Red Fire (30 TP): Grants +3 to all rolls for 10 minutes.- Red Focus (30 TP): Extends a roll by the Willpower value (WK).- Red Haste (20 TP): +200% movement speed for one turn / roll.- Red Impulse (60 TP): +200% movement speed for one turn / roll.

| Blood Pact (B) | 1 | Damage | MP | 10 m | Connects two targets or a target and the caster. They share pain, damage (25% goes to the pact partner), but also Stamina and Sympathy over the duration of the effect. So one pact partner can attack the other e.g. only against overcoming (PY against SG 25). Lasts max. one hour. | - |
| Blood Robbery (B) | 1 | 1 | Drain | MP | BB | Drains the target's IN +5 hit points as well as IN / 4 points Stamina (EN). Cannot trigger Red Thirst, but can only regenerate a maximum of 30% of the caster's hit points. | - |
| Blood Scythe | 0 | 1 | Projectile | PJ | 10 m | Silent, nearly invisible shadow blade that deals variable damage to a target without leaving wounds. From the ambush, the victim itself only notices very late that it is about to be wounded (BE vs SG 25). How much damage the Blood Scythe does depends on the caster: every hit point it pays, the target suffers two times the damage. | Does not require a blood band. Also does not work against undead, constructs, etc. |
| Blood Stop (B) | 1 | 1 | Manipulation | MP | BB | Stops the target's blood circulation for a moment if successful (MP vs WD +3). It suffers 30 points of damage and is paralyzed for 1 R. | Requires two blood bands. |

Causes one stress point. |
| Claw (B) | 0 | 1 | Damage | MP | BB | Inflicts (Intelligence / 2) points of damage to the target every turn while connected to the caster via a blood bond. | - |
| Boiling Blood (B) | 1 | 1 | Damage | MP | BB | Channeling: Causes blood to become damagingly hot over 3 R. Deals 30, then 20, then 10 points of damage if successful. The target must also overcome the pain each round to act at all -5 on all rolls (PY vs SG 22). | - |
| Correction (B) | 1 | - | Manipulation | MP | BB | Permanently deforms flesh. Can correct blemishes (like overbite, bags under eyes etc.) (KE against SG 15-25), heal ulcers or regenerate mutations, among other things.

| Puppet (B) | 2 | 3 | Channeling | MP | BB /12 m | Channeling: The caster subdues the target's entire bloodstream for the first two rounds (MP vs AT). Failure does not reset progress. After the 2nd successful subjugation round, the caster controls a target's body and can have it perform simple commands (MP vs. AT +5). However, it moves inauthentically and fights with different stats (the MP becomes the target's AW, VW, AUW). | - |
| Placenta (B) | 1 | 2 | Protection | MP | BB | Protection Magic: Creates a lump of magical, waxy flesh on the target (can also be the caster) that stays on the body for about ten minutes. If this suffers a wound, it can be closed by the substance if desired, negating the damage taken.Risk: If the spell is cast with a W1, the victim suffers a mutation level. | No healing spell, damage must be negated instantly. |
| Cripple | 0 | 1 | Damage | MP | BB | Debilitates the target by -2 to all rolls for the remainder of the Blood Band. Can be cast three times per target. | Does not work against undead, constructs, etc. |

| Shape Flesh | The caster influences the flesh of a lifeform (fixed if possible) in a forbidden way, so that it takes on other forms or even forms new organs or properties, like bone plates or claws: MP vs often high SG. Has a very high failure rate, which can plague the creature with tumors, mutate it, or even kill it. Young or unborn creatures reduce SG. The creation of body parts and traits must be learned similar to potion recipes or blueprints - if possible on lifeforms, which is why it is forbidden. | caster bag,healer bag | 1 charge(each) |

| Lightning Walker | 2 | 3 | Manipulation | MP | - | The caster accelerates itself enormously. In this phase, which lasts five turns, he can not only move quickly to any position on the battlefield, but also perform light manipulation on real time, e.g.: Correct an attack = +5 AW for the attacker or +5 VW / AUW for the defender. Change a shot trajectory = -15 or +10 AW for a shooter. Push or pull a person to affect throws. Tampering with a person's holster belt (loosening items, igniting bombs, etc.). | - |
| Dimensional Discus | 3 | 1 | Projectile | MP | 30 m | Deadly Extension of Solid: Creates an approximately 30 cm wide, immobile, and barely visible discus of solidified space-time that slices through almost any matter. If a target collides with it (BE vs. SG 25), it suffers (Luck Roll x 8) damage and may even lose limbs (due to e.g. Zone or Critical hits). | - |
| Dimensional Dungeon | 2 | 5 | Manipulation/Canalization | MP | 5 m | The caster channels the time structure and cuts an area up to a maximum of 10 x 10 x 10 meters out of the ordinary space-time (MP vs. SG). This area is kept inaccessible and not to be left in a kind of in-between world as long as the caster concentrates on it. Gases (as well as breathable air) continue to enter and exit, as do muffled sounds. Seeing from the inside out or the other way around, however, is almost impossible due to the distortion. Also requires 2 EN from the caster every 5 minutes. | Can be sustained for hours or longer using a power source. |
| Dimensional Bag | 1-X | / | Manipulation | MP | 3 m | Creates an extradimensional bag in which items and even living creatures can be stored, with an inventory slot costing 1 Stamina (EN) every time of day (a human, for example, costs 5). If the caster so desires, or if his Stamina is nearing its end, the contents will materialize a maximum of three meters away from him. Ideal for hiding things or transporting them at a short distance. | - |

 |
| Zero Time | 1 | 2 | Manipulation | MP | - | The caster slows the passage of time for his or a soul to almost a standstill, so that a second passes in over an hour for him. He cannot move during this time, but he can formulate quick-witted answers or mentally prepare for an attack. Upon his return from null time, he gains +6 RH, as well as +3 to combat-relevant rolls for 3 rounds. | Being trapped in an immobile body causes 1 Stress (SG 25). |
| Weightlessness | 1-X | 5 | Force Field / Channeling | MP | 10 m | Creates a field of lifted space-time, causing an object or person to become nearly weightless for five minutes. How much weight this is, is decided by the Stamina (EN)-effort:1 Stamina (EN) = 100 kg to 1 kg.2 Stamina (EN) = 200 kg to 10 kg.3 Stamina (EN) = 300 kg to 75 kg.4 Stamina (EN) = 400 kg to 200 kg. | - |
| Blocking | 0-X | 2 | Channeling | MP | 10 m | Seals from the 2nd round on an object up to 120 kg (like a door or a piece of furniture, no carried weapon e.g.) immovable and indestructible in space. Useful as a blockade, bridge and more. Costs 1 Stamina (EN) for 10 minutes after one minute. | - |
| Temporal Pocket | 1 | 2 | Force Field | PJ | 3 m | Stores a cast projection spell, fired projectile, or hurled weapon (but also a bird in flight or other object) in a bubble of suspended time. This lasts about an hour and can be released at any time during that time (even while the caster is casting another spell or performing an action in parallel), releasing the contents with the rules of a projection spell against a target. | - |
| Slow Down | 0 | 1 | Manipulation | MP | 10 m | Slows down the target slightly, making its actions more predictable: -5 AW, -5 VW / AUW, but 50% damage resistance for the rest of the fight or until the caster cancels the spell (takes another turn). | Requires one round to be deactivated again. |
| Speed Up | 0 | 1 | Manipulation | MP | 10 m | Slightly speeds up the target. It gains +5 AW, +5 VW / AUW, +50% damage, and +8 on all Athletics rolls. However, the dilation damages the target for 10 TP every round. | Requires one round to be deactivated again. |
| Displace | 1-5 | 1 | Teleportation | MP | 10 m | Displace the caster from one moment to the next up to max. 10 meters (MP vs. SG 20). Works through small openings (as long as they are about the size of a head) or into fog or darkness. Can also be heavily modified for 1 Stamina (EN) each:- Range is doubled, at the same time the spell becomes silent.- Can displace up to five entities (people as well as animals) with.- Displaces an object up to 100 kg instead of the caster.- Can be used against 3 EN as an escape reflex against attacks: The caster gains +25 dodge value and leaves any combat bind. | Target must be in sight |

| Seeing Ahead | 2-X | - | Vision | MP | 1.5 km | The caster sees into the future for five minutes up to a maximum of one week and suffers 2 stress points. However, the spell does not work intuitively - place and time must be determined exactly before the vision. EN consumption varies with distance, three- and four-dimensional. | Does not work against and in magically protected places. |
| Turn Back Time\* | 1 | 3 | Manipulation | MP | - | Turns back time by up to one minute, but inflicts 30 points of damage and three points of stress on the caster. Only he can remember what happened afterwards. In combat, this also gives him +10 on all rolls for the next three to five turns, as long as he doesn't change the future too much.(For more description, see below) | - |
| Time Crystal | 1 | 2 | Force Field /Channeling | PJ | 7.5 m | Captures a creature up to about 200 kg or a space of 4 m³ and slows it down to a virtual standstill for three rounds. In this state, the victim is not vulnerable, the room, the crystal can not be entered, but can be moved. After three rounds, the target usually returns to normal time disoriented (BE against SG 20). Cannot be resisted and costs the caster 1 EN every three rounds. | Cannot sever or exclude body parts. |
| Time Rift | 0 | 1 | Projection | PJ | 7.5 m | Projects an unstable fissure of slowed spacetime onto a target with risky effect:W1 = Deals 100 damage to caster and immediate surroundings. W2-W9 = Randomly (lucky roll) deals 30 damage against combatants.W10-W15 = Deals 40 damage against the target.W16-W19 = Deals 60 damage against the target.W20 = Deals 200 damage against the target, can sever body parts or even split it. | - |
| Distort Corridor | 0 | 1 | Projection | PJ | 10 m | Creates a 1.5 m wide, ten meter long corridor of distorted space-time in front of the caster, dealing 5 points of damage to each target within it. | - |
| Look Back | 1-X | - | Vision | MP | 1.5 km | The caster sees into the past for max. five minutes up to one year and suffers 2 stress for it. However, the spell does not work intuitively - place and time must be determined exactly before the vision. EN consumption varies with distance, three- and four-dimensional (spatial and temporal). | Does not work against and in magically protected places. |

### Turn back time
 In fact, it is not possible to turn back the time of the universe. Therefore, the most common theory of turning back time is that the aether exists in all times simultaneously, and the chronomancer merely receives information about a probable future intuitively from the aetheric plexus. The consequence is physical damage.

### Rituals

| Activity | Effect | Pocket | Consumed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shift | The caster cuts a space of about 10 x 10 x 10 meters out of the time structure in a complicated but also risky ritual (MP vs. mostly high SG) and shifts it to a distance of max. 100 m at the end of the ritual. ## Caster pocket ## 5 charge

## Entropy

Enables / Enhances: High-risk destruction and energy spells, as well as the overall casting efficiency and effect of spells.

Energy Requirement: A majority of entropy spells, especially those focused on energy, require a charge from an energist.

High Risk: Entropy spells cannot be rolled as a routine due to their volatile, unpredictable nature. In addition, a Critical Failure (W1) often results in devastating consequences, such as explosions that cost the caster their hand, destruction of the Apparatus, and more.

| Fission | 1 | 1-4 | Manipulation | MP | B | The caster adds energy to a fist-sized object (such as a rock, a slingshot or even an arrow) and turns it into a bomb, each round increasing the damaging effect of the explosion. If the fission is finally thrown (throwing weapons), fired or detonated, it does damage like a shockwave: 100% at the epicenter, therefore 50%, therefore 25%.The damage scales itself here at the time of the charge:1st round: 20 / 10 / 52. Round: 50 / 25 / 173. round: 100 / 50 / 254. round: 200 / 100 / 50 (Risk: In this round MP must be thrown against SG 20 to see if the fission does not explode in the hand of the caster and cause 100 points of damage to him) | Requires an energist charge. |

| Moonbeam | 1 | 1-X | Projection / Channeling | PJ | 12 m | Channeling: Creates a bright, all-burning beam that gets stronger every round: 5, 20, 40, 80, 160, up to 200 / R. Can melt through walls under certain circumstances. | Costs 1 EN every other round. Also requires an Energist charge. |
| Maelstrom | 1-2 | 2 | Summon | PJ | 1.5 m | Creates a man-sized whirlwind of pure energy in front of the caster, which travels one hex in a predetermined direction every turn after summoning (straight ahead only, it cannot turn). If an entity gets caught in this maelstrom, it suffers 100 points of damage and loses 10 RW. After three turns at the latest, the energy vortex dries up and goes out. | Bright flicker announces where the maelstrom will appear. Also requires an Energist charge. |
| Sun Disc | 2 | 2 | Projectile | PJ | 4.5 m | Fires imprecisely (-10 PJ) a burning disc of light about one meter in diameter. This effortlessly cuts through flesh and melts metal, causes 100 DMG, destroys 8 RW, and can sever body parts if critically successful. | Requires an Energist charge. |
| Vortex | 1-5 | 1-3 | Channeling | MP | 10 m | The caster creates a gravity vortex in the form of a black ball at a point within a 10 m radius that pulls everything in a 3 m, then 4.5 m and finally 6 m radius towards it. Anyone who wants to escape its pull must pass AT against SG 22. Whoever falls below 15 is pulled to the center and suffers 45 points of damage per round. The caster meanwhile invests 1 EN / R.After three rounds the channeling can be aborted, whereupon in the fourth the compressed air and matter is released with an explosion that inflicts 140 damage to all entities in radius of 6 m and 70 damage in radius of 8 m. The caster can then be used as a channeler. | If 3 Stamina (EN) is invested at the beginning instead of 1, the Vortex works independently and not as a channeling. |
| Decomposition | 0 | 1 | Manipulation | MP | 7.5 m | Randomly decomposes some matter. Does little damage against creatures (5 points of damage), but destroys armor for 4 RW per turn. | - |

After that, the ground begins to grab at it, reducing its physical rolls by 3 each round, while it must free itself with KK against SG 22. If its physical strength drops to 0, the target becomes fixed and can be devoured up to the head or completely without resistance. | - |
| Sink | 1-X | - | Manipulation | MP | 10 m | Captures a motionless object up to a size of 5 x 5 meters and makes it sink ten centimeters into the ground round by round. Each half meter requires 1 Stamina (EN). | - |

### Rituals

| Earth Architecture | Deforms earth, rock and even metal. EN expenditure, SG and efficiency depend significantly on density: MP vs SG. For example, digging a 6m long trench or wall out of earth costs 0 EN, the same with rock already 1.
