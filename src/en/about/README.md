# What is Pen & Pendulum

Pen & Pendulum is a roleplaying system created by Maximilan Wust and Martin Wust. 

It offers lean, fast combat and skill progression, and thus more playtime for role-playing and simulation elements.

Great depth of play is achieved in this system, among other things, through the abundance of abilities and options.
