# Character creation

The recommended process for creating a Pen & Pendulum character:

## Who is my character?
- Choose a profession
- Choose a race
- Briefly explore the skills for inspiration
- Create a backstory

## What exactly can my character do?
- Distribute all attribute points
- Distribute all ability points

The backstory should be adjusted to the other steps, or vice versa, distributing points, class, etc. to the backstory.
