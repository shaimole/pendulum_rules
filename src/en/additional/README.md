## Weapons and combat 1/2

### Weapon classes, advantages and disadvantages:

|Crossbows:|Armor-busting ranged attacks, but with risky reload times.|
| - | - |
|Bows:|Ranged combat. Wielded two-handed, but allows items (such as potions or bombs) to be deployed one round faster.|
|Daggers:|Fast and small: Allow special special attacks, but no parry.|
|One-Handed Weapon (free):|Gadgets (like potions or bombs) can be used within one turn.|
|Whip:|Highly effective, but must always be brought into swing first for one turn.|
|Whips:|More of a support weapon. Long whips cannot be used in direct field-to-field close combat.
|Slings:|Light ranged weapon, can also be used in melee as a flail.|
|Spears:|Are usually also used as walking sticks and do not need to be drawn a turn in combat. Are often ranged weapons and very unstable.
|Unarmed:|Get +4 dodge value (AUW), as long as the weapon class Unarmed has been learned.|
|Weapon with shield:|Increased defense value (varies with the shield worn). In addition, it is possible to safely leave the combat bind at any time.
|Throw weapons|Remote combat attack with all bonuses. Cannot be performed in combat bind.|
|Two Weapons:|Grants +4 attack value, but no doubled damage.|
|Two Hand Weapons:|Provide increased damage, usually around 50%.|

### Weapon Stability:

Almost every weapon is damaged by a Critical Failure (W1). There are three levels of damage:

- Damaged: Weapon damage is halved, plus it costs 4 AW to use. Examples of this level are a bent blade or a warped crossbow barrel.
- Defective: The weapon is no longer usable, but can still be repaired. Examples include a broken bowstring or a broken spear shaft. Bows and spears usually change directly to this level after a Critical Failure (W1).
- Destroyed: The weapon has been irreparably cracked or destroyed, such as a broken rapier or burst sword.

### Ranged Combat:

- Basically, the AW and die count must exceed a SG 10 to hit at all.
- This SG increases with distance: 10 yards = SG 10, 20 yards = SG 15, etc.
- Projectile attacks (like by arrows, bolts or small throwing weapons) can only be partially dodged: On a success, you suffer a graze hit that halves the damage. On the other hand, it is possible to dodge a projectile an unlimited number of times, i.e. to reduce it to a grazing hit.
- Projectile attacks can be blocked with a shield comparable to a melee attack.
- Projectile attacks (as with large throwing weapons) are considered melee attacks and can be dodged, parried, and blocked. This does not apply to various projectile spells, such as a fireball.

### Combat Binding:

- If two fighters meet in close combat, they enter into a so-called combat bond.
- If one of them leaves the bond, the remaining one receives a free, unopposed attack.
- One character can usually "treat" another with full VW and AUW. If he is attacked by more than one person at once, he is flanked and suffers -5 VW.
- Ranged combatants such as casters can be inhibited in combat bind. They can only attack or cast if they either pass a Willpower roll for each action (PY vs SG 20) or invest one point of Stamina (EN). This can also be "paid" after a failed roll.

## Weapons 2/2

### Flails:

Flails have a movable headpiece that is usually anchored to the hilt with a ring or chain, but can be swung freely. This circumstance is described as follows:

- Flails require one round to get going and be ready for use.
- If you attack a shield with it or the opponent dodges it AND roll W5 or below, you take the damage yourself.
- If you parry against a flail and the attacker rolls a W15 or higher, the weapons lock against each other. A blade lock occurs (KK against KK) - but if you lose, you are disarmed.
- A two-handed flail, on the other hand, cannot be parried with a weapon. Against its force only dodging or a shield will work. If you try to use a weapon, the defender will be disarmed.
- If a flail is successfully deflected, it loses its momentum and must be brought in again over a turn.

### Whips:

Whips are not effective weapons in the strictest sense. Easily damaged and difficult to use, they usually do little damage. However, they can be used in a variety of ways as support:

- Whips are mostly ranged weapons and can be used over two squares (3m).
- If an enemy successfully parries the whip attack with the weapon, the whip wraps around it and a force duel ensues (defender's KK vs. attacker's KK -3). If the defender wins, the whip is snatched from the attacker's hand. If the attacker wins, he gets his whip back.

### Wrestling / Blade Locks / Weapon Locks:

A wrestling match means that two opponents have become so intertwined that regular melee weapons no longer work.

- The wrestling match is triggered by the attacker and defender reaching the exact same AW-VW value or by special abilities that provoke exactly that.
- The attacker can dispense with the blade lock, but this grants the defender a free attack.
- In wrestling, both parties must choose one of three actions before each round: Hold, Overpower, and Retreat.


|Again|Hold|Overwhelm|Retreat|
| :-: | - | - | - |
|Hold|Both parties remain in the wrestling match or lock.|KK vs KK (min. difference 5) decides whether the defender gets a free, undefendable attack.|KK vs KK (min. difference 5). If successful, the attacker keeps the defender in the block.|
|Overwhelm|KK against KK (min. difference 5) decides if the attacker gets a free, undefendable attack.|KK against KK (min. difference 5). The winner receives a free, undefendable attack.|The attacker immediately receives a free, undefendable attack.|
|Retreat|KK against KK (min. difference 5). If successful, the attacker escapes from the lock.|The defender immediately receives a free, undefendable attack.|Both parties immediately retreat from the lock.

## Light conditions

|Light|Effect|
| - | - |
|||
|Day|No Mali|
|Dusk|As during dusk or torchlight: The character suffers -3 AW / VW / AUW in combat and up to -10 on e.g. search rolls.|
|Darkness|Near Darkness: The character suffers -10 to all combat-related rolls and can no longer perform many actions such as activities. Can be negated by residual light enhancement.|
|Eclipse|Absolute Darkness.|

## Daytime

The day is divided into six segments (called times of day) for capture reasons. These are:


|time|time of day|
| - | - |
|||
|0-4|Late night|
|4-8|morning (twilight)|
|8-12|morning|
|12-16|afternoon|
|16-20|Evening (twilight)|
|20-24|night|

This means:

- An activity (such as armor repair, learning an ability, or potion brewing) requires a daytime segment.
- A character must sleep during two of these segments. If only one is slept, he gets a deduction of 1 EN, the same if the two are spread out.
- Mornings and afternoons can be spent working, fighting, exploring and gathering without malus, mornings and evenings only with sufficient light sources (e.g. a campfire), nights only with particularly effective lighting.
- Likewise, travel should only take place during the day (mornings and afternoons). In the twilight hours (morning and evening) it is already slowed down, at night hardly possible.


## Alchemy: Info and Glossary

Physical Limits:

A character can only endure two potions (i.e. including elixirs, injections, or pastilles) a day without suffering side effects. After that, a resist SG of 20 increases by 5 with each potion, and if this is not passed, the ...

Side effects:

W1 = The sufferer suffers a severe shock, he goes K.O. (with all effects). Until the end of the day he has only one temporary hit point.

W2-W7 = The affected person vomits bloody and suffers 20 damage points. All potion effects are canceled.

W8-W13 = Severe vomiting and sweating: All effects received from potions are canceled.

W14-W19 = Severe Nausea, -2 to all rolls for one time of day for the rest of the day.

W20 = Fullness, bloating, and mild nausea, no negative effects. -2 on infiltrations for the day.

Potion types:

Elixir = High potency potion; effects take several hours to set in and often last a day.

Essence = High dose; put in a fish bladder or leather ball in the mouth and bite into it

Potion = Potion; effect sets in quickly and lasts only a short time

Pastille = lozenge; effect sets in after several hours and often lasts a day

Poisons:

Contact = Poisoned by mere contact with the skin

Injection = Poisoned after being injected into the bloodstream, e.g. with a dagger or an arrow.

Oral = Poisoned after ingestion, such as through food and drink

Bombs:

Fire = Creates primarily fire, can ignite objects.

Explosion = Detonates

Gas = Creates a cloud of gas

Other:

Oil = Weapon oil; must be rubbed on weapon, effect often lasts a full day

## Difficulty levels:

1-10 = Can be made with simple cooking utensils.

From 11 = Requires an alchemy kit

A "stationary" alchemy lab can massively lower SG, depending on equipment.
